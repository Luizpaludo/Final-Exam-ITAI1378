# Final-Exam-ITAI1378
# License plate detector + gate opener.

## Project overview
The original goal of this project was to build a license plate detection system using the YOLO object detection model. During development, the project was expanded into a complete AI-powered gate access system.
The final system detects a vehicle's license plate using a custom-trained YOLO11 model, extracts the license plate text using EasyOCR, and compares the detected plate with a database of authorized vehicles. Based on the comparison, the system displays either **Access Granted** or **Access Denied**.
